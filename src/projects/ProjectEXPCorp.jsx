                    <p className="text-justify"><span className="text-blue-400 font-bold">EXPCorp.</span> is a website for a fictional company that offers <span className="text-blue-400 font-bold">virtual experiences</span> to the elderly. This concept was created based on a brainstorming session during which our team shared ideas about <span className="text-blue-400 font-bold">dystopian</span> and <span className="text-blue-400 font-bold">utopian scenarios</span>. We decided to work on a fictional scenario in which <span className="text-blue-400 font-bold">Virtual Reality</span> takes over the world. Our next step was developing a website that suited that scenario, and <span className="text-blue-400 font-bold">EXPCorp.</span> was born. <span className="text-blue-400 font-bold">EXPCorp.</span> offers nine unique <span className="text-blue-400 font-bold">virtual experiences</span> that can be used with or without a <span className="text-blue-400 font-bold">VR headset</span>. The website also features a <span className="text-blue-400 font-bold">product page</span> and an interactive question system to determine which <span className="text-blue-400 font-bold">VR gear</span> suits you best. <span className="text-blue-400 font-bold">EXPCorp.</span> was never intended to be a solution, but rather a means to make people think about the future of technology.</p>
